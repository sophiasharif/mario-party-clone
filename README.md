# mario-party-clone
This is a clone of Mario Party implemented as part of my CS 32 class at UCLA. 

PeachParty is a two-player game that manages 100+ game actors every tick with 1000+ lines of code. The technical difficulty of this project was in using proper OOP style to get the many actors to interact with each other elegantly, using inheritence and polymorphism to reduce bugs and code repeat, and managing memory properly.
